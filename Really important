IMPORTANT

I took this code

Power[1:1440,"Time"] <- format(Power[1:1440,"Time"],"2007-02-01 %H:%M:%S")
Power[1441:2880,"Time"] <- format(Power[1441:2880,"Time"],"2007-02-02 %H:%M:%S")

from stack overflow, i was running into a problem for the plot to read the date in an accurate manner

The rest of the code is my own
